                        More than 30 years ago, after 15 years of working for industry-leading tech firms, two friends came together and founded SOAL TECHNOLOGIES. They believed that leaving a career path in the hands of employers was backwards-looking and that talent deserved a partner to advise them along the way. That is why they founded a company to provide a reliable path to job seekers and global workforce solutions to employers. We are recognized among the best recruiting agencies in the staffing industry for our performance-driven attitude and structured work process.
